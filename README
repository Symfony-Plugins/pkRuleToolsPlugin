= pkRuleTools =

Handy tools for matching paths with simple rules in configuration
files and the like. We use it in pkContextCMSPlugin to assign templates
to newly created pages. Perhaps you'll find it useful as well.

== Usage ==

 Simple path-matching rules. They work like this:
 * matches anything
 % matches anything except / (great for directory components)
  
Call pkRuleTools::select() with an array of rules and a string to be matched. 
Each rule is an associative array with a key named 'rule' that contains
the actual pattern. select returns the entire associative array
for the first matching rule, or false if no rules match. This means that
you can store your own information in the other keys of the array.

This is very handy in CMS configuration files. Example
(for a CMS with rooted paths):

      template_rules: 

        # Home page gets homePage

        - rule: "/"
          template: homePage
        
        # All second level pages get secondPage
        
        - rule: "/%/%"
          template: secondPage
        
        # All descendants (not just direct children) of /faq/ get faqPage.
        # For direct children only, use % instead of *

        - rule: "/home/faq/*"
          template: faqPage
        
        Everything else gets simplePage
        - rule: "*"
          template: simplePage
